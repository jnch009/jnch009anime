## Anime

This is a responsive web app that allows you to scroll through various Manga and Anime pages with the help of pagination as well as allowing you to search for Anime as well. Each card can be clicked to view more details about the Manga/Anime including the characters, synopsis and rating.

The Anime and Manga and Search endpoints were utilized from the Jikan API (https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/information).

Future Ideas I have include: the ability to search for Manga as well, adding the voice actors' pictures to the detail modal, and the ability to view more detail about each character as well.
